# NGOFS notes

### PORTS: Physical Oceanographic Real-Time System (PORTS)

- Real-time data... aid navigation
- NOS: develop numerical... predictions... short-term forecast..
-- water levels, currents, salinity, temp
- Lead to development of NGOFS

### NGOFS:

Based on FVCOM, characterized by
- 3D
- Unstructured grid
- Free-surface primitive

- A great example of FVCOM is NECOFS,
  providing real-time data since 2007

Chosen since it handles:
- meso-scale eddies
- wind-based coastal circulation
- smaller scale coast/estuarine circ..
-- based on shorelines, topography, tides, freshwater input

Provides
- 2-day forecast
- ... but low res


### NWGOFS, NEGOFS

- higher resolution in key inshore regions
-- bays, coastal waterways
-- these show high spatial/temporal variability
- These models are __nested__ in NGOFS

Some NWGOFS stats (as of paper date)
-- For 'node' and 'element' definitions, _mesh_ literature
- Num nodes: 84653
- Num (triangular) elements: 160,444
- Element size: 60m - 3.5 km
- Rivers: 22

Shoreline data: NOAA National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) high0res coastline database

Model hindcast
- starts at Sept. 14, 2010  00:00:00
- Takes ~7 days for salinity, temp to reach equilibrium
- Sim results are compared to stations for model verification
- __Examples exist of model underestimating peak tidal current speed_
- Paper has table of RMS error for each station... could use for game-theory uncertainty?

Nesting approach
- One-way coupling with NGOFS
-- 1. NGOFS run --> surface elev., 3D velocities, temp, salinity at _nesting boundary nodes & elems_
-- 2. Nested model runs, using the NGOFS boundaries + atmos. surface forcing + river forcing


Ouptuts:
- NGOFS: Sigma levels (41): resolve vertical structures
- N(W|E)GOFS: both (41) and (21) tested... evaluate effect of # of layers -> insignif. difference
- --> N(W|E)GOFS uses 21 levels.

#### Forecast

- Types:
-- Point ("forecast"):
-- Gridded ("regulargrid"):
